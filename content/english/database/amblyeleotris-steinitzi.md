Steinitz's Prawn Goby (Amblyeleotris steinitzi) is a small fish, typically growing up to 10 cm in length. It has a slender, elongated body with a pale coloration that can range from white to light beige. The body is marked with several broad, vertical orange or reddish-brown bands. It has large, expressive eyes and a distinctive high dorsal fin. The caudal fin (tail fin) is rounded, and it has long pectoral fins that it uses to prop itself up on the substrate.

Steinitz's Prawn Goby is found in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in shallow coastal waters and coral reefs. It prefers sandy or rubble substrates where it can easily burrow. This species is known for its symbiotic relationship with alpheid shrimp, also known as pistol shrimp. The goby and the shrimp share a burrow, with the shrimp maintaining the burrow and the goby acting as a lookout for predators.

Amblyeleotris steinitzi reproduces through external fertilization. During the breeding season, males and females pair up and the female lays eggs in a sheltered location within the burrow. The male fertilizes the eggs, and both parents guard the eggs until they hatch. The larvae are pelagic, drifting in the open water before settling down and developing into juvenile gobies.

Steinitz's Prawn Goby primarily feeds on small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and worms. It uses its keen eyesight to detect prey and captures it by quickly darting out from its burrow. The goby’s diet also includes small amounts of algae and detritus.

Steinitz's Prawn Goby is not dangerous to divers. It is a timid fish that will quickly retreat to its burrow at the first sign of danger.
