The Dusky Parrotfish (Scarus niger) is a species of marine fish from the parrotfish family.

This fish gets its name from the parrot-like shape of its head and its dark coloration. It is known for its significant contribution to coral reef ecosystems, as it helps maintain reef balance by feeding on corals and algae.

As adults, dusky parrotfish reach about 23â€“24 cm in length and weigh approximately 240 g. The maximum recorded body length is 40 cm.

The dusky parrotfish has an elongated body covered with large scales. Its coloration varies depending on age and sex but often includes shades of blue, green, purple, and black. Juveniles are more subdued in color, while adult males exhibit brighter hues.

The dorsal fin has 9 spiny and 10 soft rays, while the anal fin features 3 spiny and 9 soft rays.

Dusky parrotfish inhabit the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to Hawaii and Polynesia. They are commonly found on coral reefs at depths of 2 to 25 meters.

Individuals of this species are often solitary, although males may live in groups with several breeding females. The dusky parrotfish is a protogynous hermaphrodite, as evidenced by cases where a dominant female in an all-female group transforms into a male. During the spawning season, males and females form pairs.

This fish primarily feeds on algae, which it scrapes off coral surfaces. By doing so, the dusky parrotfish helps prevent the overgrowth of algae, which can harm reefs. While feeding, the fish accidentally ingests coral fragments, which are ground into sand in its stomach.
