The mosaic jellyfish has a dome-shaped body that can grow up to 35 cm in diameter. Its color ranges from bluish-white to creamy, with a pattern resembling mosaic or cellular textures on the dome. The jellyfish has short, frilled tentacles underneath that create a fan-like appearance.

The mosaic jellyfish is found in the warm waters of the Indo-Pacific region, particularly near the coasts of Australia, Japan, and India. It inhabits shallow lagoons and the outer slopes of coral reefs at depths ranging from 2 to 55 meters.

This jellyfish feeds on plankton, small fish, and crustaceans. It filters water using its tentacles to capture food.

The mosaic jellyfish is not considered highly dangerous to humans. However, contact with its tentacles can cause skin irritation or mild stings. Its venom is not life-threatening and usually results in minor symptoms.
