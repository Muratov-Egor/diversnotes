The Whitetail Dascyllus (Dascyllus aruanus) is a small fish, typically reaching up to 9 cm in length. It has a distinct appearance characterized by its black and white coloration. The body is predominantly white with three vertical black stripes: one through the eye, one through the middle of the body, and one at the base of the tail. The tail is entirely white, which is a prominent identifying feature. Its body is laterally compressed, giving it a somewhat oval shape.

Dascyllus aruanus is commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around coral reefs and lagoons. They are usually seen at depths ranging from 1 to 12 meters. These fish prefer to stay close to branching corals, which offer them protection and places to hide from predators.

The Whitetail Dascyllus reproduces through external fertilization. Males prepare and guard a nesting site within the corals, where females lay their eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and continues to guard them until they hatch. The larvae are pelagic, meaning they drift in the open water before settling down and developing into juvenile fish.

Dascyllus aruanus primarily feeds on plankton and small invertebrates. They also consume algae and detritus, making them omnivorous. They often feed in small groups, taking advantage of the protection offered by their numbers.

Whitetail Dascyllus are not dangerous to divers. They are generally curious and may approach divers, but they pose no threat. Their small size and peaceful nature make them harmless to humans.
