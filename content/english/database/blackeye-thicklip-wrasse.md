Belonging to the wrasse family, the blackeye thicklip wrasse, also known as the half-and-half wrasse (Hemigymnus melapterus), hails from the Indo-Pacific region.

This medium-sized fish can grow up to 50 cm in length, boasting a tall, somewhat flattened body, a sizable head, and thick-lipped terminal mouth. Its body coloration varies with age. Juvenile wrasse sport a greenish-yellow hue with yellow vertical stripes, a wide white diagonal band just behind the operculum, an orange caudal fin, and a greenish-gray front. Mature females exhibit green coloring behind the diagonal line, featuring scales rimmed in black, with intricate pink lines underscored by turquoise from snout to head. Fully developed males (in their terminal phase) flaunt emerald green stripes behind each scale, a blue eye rim, and green snouts and heads adorned with pink patterns highlighted in turquoise.

This species thrives in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, spanning from the eastern coast of Africa, including the Red Sea, to Polynesia, and from New Caledonia to southern Japan. It favors habitats like coral, coral rubble, sandy areas, outer reef slopes, and drop-offs, often found at depths exceeding 40 meters. Juveniles, however, tend to be more reclusive, seeking refuge within branching corals.

The half-and-half wrasse typically leads a solitary or small-group lifestyle. As a benthic predator, it primarily preys on small marine invertebrates such as crustaceans, mollusks, worms, and echinoderms found on or within the substrate. Apart from foraging on coral branches, it may ingest mouthfuls of sand, sifting out food items before expelling the sand through its gill operculae. Like many wrasse species, it displays protogynous hermaphroditism, starting life as females with the potential to transition to males later on.
