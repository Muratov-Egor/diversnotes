The Blue Sea Star is known for its striking blue color, which can range from light blue to deep blue. Occasionally, individuals may exhibit shades of green or purple. It typically has five arms (rays), which can grow up to 30 cm in length, though specimens with more arms are also found. The surface of the body is smooth, dotted with small bumps, and often covered with tiny spines.

Linckia laevigata inhabits tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. It can be found on coral reefs, in lagoons, and on sandy bottoms at depths ranging from 1 to 60 meters. The Blue Sea Star is most commonly seen around the Great Barrier Reef, as well as in the waters of Indonesia, the Philippines, Micronesia, and other parts of the Indo-Pacific region.

The Blue Sea Star feeds on microorganisms and organic particles found on the surfaces of corals and other substrates. Its primary diet consists of bacterial films and detritus. To feed, it everts its stomach over the food source, covers it, and then digests it externally.

Linckia laevigata reproduces both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction occurs through spawning, where males and females release their gametes into the water column, leading to external fertilization. The larvae then float in the plankton until they settle to the bottom and develop into young sea stars. Asexual reproduction happens through autotomy, where the sea star can shed one of its arms, which then regenerates into a new individual.

These sea stars are generally slow-moving and do not harm humans. However, divers are advised not to touch sea stars or other marine life to avoid stressing the animals and potentially damaging their delicate skin.
