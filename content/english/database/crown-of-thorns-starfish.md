The Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a large starfish, reaching up to 60 cm in diameter. It has numerous long, pointed arms, usually between 12 and 19, covered in venomous spines. The spines cover both the upper and lower surfaces of the arms and body. Its coloration varies from red and purple to green and brown, aiding in its camouflage among corals.

The Crown-of-Thorns starfish is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea to Central America. It prefers coral reefs at depths ranging from 1 to 30 meters, but can sometimes be found at greater depths.

The Crown-of-Thorns starfish is a corallivorous starfish. Its primary food source is hard corals, which it digests externally by everting its stomach and secreting digestive enzymes that break down coral tissue. This can lead to significant destruction of coral reefs, especially during population outbreaks.

Reproduction in the Crown-of-Thorns starfish occurs via spawning. Females can produce up to 60 million eggs in a single spawning event. Eggs and sperm are released into the water, where external fertilization occurs. Larvae develop in the plankton and settle on the seabed after several weeks, transforming into juvenile starfish.

The Crown-of-Thorns starfish poses a danger to divers due to its venomous spines. Contact with the spines can cause severe pain, swelling, nausea, and even paralysis. Wounds from the spines can take a long time to heal and are susceptible to infection.
