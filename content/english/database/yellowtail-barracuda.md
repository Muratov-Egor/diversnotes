Yellowtail barracuda (Sphyraena flavicauda) is a small species of barracuda from the family Sphyraenidae, native to the Indo-Western Pacific. It has also entered the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea.

The yellowtail barracuda has an elongated body with two well-separated dorsal fins. The front dorsal fin has five spines, the first being the longest, while the second dorsal fin is slightly ahead of the anal fin. The pelvic fin is located below the tip of the pectoral fin, which in turn is positioned ahead of the front dorsal fin. Its large head is slightly flattened towards the back, with a large eye, pointed snout, and long jaws, featuring a prognathous lower jaw. The upper jaw contains several fang-like teeth, followed by 4-5 sharp teeth in a single row on the palate and a row of smaller teeth on the premaxilla. The lower jaw has a single large fang-like tooth at the tip, followed by rows of smaller sharp teeth along each side. The back is grey with a contrasting white underside, sometimes with a yellowish hue on the sides, and the tail is yellow with black edges. They can grow up to 60 cm, but typically range between 35-40 cm.

Yellowtail barracudas are found from the Red Sea to Samoa, with their northern boundary at the Ryukyu Islands and the southern boundary at the Great Barrier Reef. During the day, they hunt in lagoons and on the inner and outer slopes of reefs, while at night, they likely prey on fish and large invertebrates. Their eggs and larvae are planktonic, while juveniles hide in highly protected coastal waters. Adults can live up to six years.
