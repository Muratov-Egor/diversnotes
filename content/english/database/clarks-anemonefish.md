Clark's Anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii), commonly referred to as the yellowtail clownfish, is known for its bright and distinctive coloration. Adult fish have a yellowish tail and an orange-yellow body with three vertical white stripes. One stripe runs through the eye, another is located in the middle of the body, and the third is near the base of the tail. The fins also have a yellow hue, sometimes with black edges. The coloration can vary depending on the region and age of the fish.

Clark's Anemonefish is found in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea, Great Barrier Reef, Micronesia, Polynesia, and Southeast Asia. It prefers to live in symbiosis with sea anemones on coral reefs at depths of up to 60 meters.

Clark's Anemonefish is omnivorous. It feeds on algae, small invertebrates, zooplankton, and leftovers from the anemone's meals. The symbiotic relationship with the anemones also provides protection from predators.

Clark's Anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning they can change sex during their lifetime. In a group, the largest individual becomes the female, and the next largest becomes the male. They lay eggs on hard surfaces near the anemone, and the male guards and cares for the eggs until they hatch, which takes about 6-8 days.

Clark's Anemonefish can become aggressive when defending their anemone if they feel threatened. Bites can be unpleasant, but they are not venomous and do not pose a serious threat.
