Fish of the genus Platax belong to the family Ephippidae within the order Perciformes. This genus comprises five species of marine fish predominantly inhabiting the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Their range extends from the coast of Africa (including the Red Sea and Madagascar) to the Atlantic coast of North America around Florida and the Pacific Ocean up to southern Japan. The greatest diversity and abundance of batfish are observed in the Indo-West Pacific, off the coasts of Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia.

Batfish are relatively small, with a maximum length of about 70 cm (Platax teira). They prefer reef zones but can also be found in open waters at depths of up to 50 meters, usually alone or in small groups. Their diet includes algae, invertebrates (including jellyfish), and small fish. Batfish play an important role in coral reef ecosystems by feeding on specific types of algae and preventing them from overgrowing the corals.

Juvenile batfish have unique defense mechanisms. The first mechanism involves camouflage. For instance, juvenile Platax orbicularis mimic the appearance of fallen mangrove leaves with their coloring and swimming style. The second mechanism is the imitation of poisonous animals, which predators avoid. Juvenile Platax pinnatus are colored and move similarly to poisonous flatworms of the genus Pseudoceros, making them less vulnerable.

As they age, batfish change their shape and coloration. Young fish have elongated dorsal and anal fins, and their bodies are yellow or orange with three black stripes. As they mature, their fins shorten, the stripes fade, and their bodies become silver with vertical stripes on the front part.

Batfish pose no threat to divers and often exhibit curiosity towards them. They are approachable and easily allow people to get close, making them popular subjects for underwater observation.

Batfish play a critical role in maintaining the health of coral reefs by consuming algae that other fish species do not eat. This prevents excessive algae growth, allowing corals to grow and thrive. Studies on the Great Barrier Reef have shown that a decline in batfish populations can lead to the degradation of reef ecosystems.

Batfish are unique and vital to the coral reef ecosystem, possessing fascinating biological features and complex defense mechanisms. Their role in maintaining reef health and their appeal to divers make them important subjects for both scientific research and ecotourism.
