The Red-breasted Wrasse, also known as the Banded Maori Wrasse, the Red-banded Wrasse, and the Scarlet-breasted Wrasse, exhibits minimal variation between juvenile and adult stages, as well as between males and females. Its robust body boasts a dark brown hue adorned with short black vertical lines, complemented by six white vertical bars and a reddish area behind the eyes, which lends it its common name. With age, the head becomes more rounded, sporting a green patch around the eye and red lines extending from it. The caudal fin features two black and white bars with red spots on the white ones.

As the Red-breasted Wrasse matures, black bars emerge on its body, while the white bars become more pronounced between them. However, in large males, these bars appear to fade at a certain stage. Tanzanian waters seldom host specimens of this size, making encounters with such large males quite rare along the mainland coast.

These wrasses are notably elusive and challenging to approach closely, often retreating upon sighting divers. They typically traverse reefs singularly, slowly scouring for prey, with adults favoring mixed reef-rubble-sandy areas, while juveniles frequent shallower waters and sea grass beds.

Distributed widely from the east coast of Africa to southern Japan, down to Australia, and across to the mid-Pacific islands, the Red-breasted Wrasse tends to inhabit depths of 12 to 20 meters, though they can be found as shallow as 4 meters or as deep as 60 meters.

Feeding primarily on crustaceans, sea urchins, and mollusks, they employ their robust jaws and two large canine teeth to crush hard shells. Functioning as protogynous hermaphrodites, they initially develop as females, with some larger individuals transitioning into males based on social cues. Oviparous in nature, dominant males often oversee a harem or multiple harems of females, with spawning rituals observed above the reef in the late afternoon and early evening, as males visit female territories to assess readiness for mating.
