The spotted boxfish (Ostracion meleagris), also known as the blue boxfish, exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism: males and females differ in coloration.

These fish are found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily inhabiting lagoons and reefs at depths ranging from 1 to 30 meters. Adults can reach lengths of up to 25 cm. They feed on sponges, worms, tunicates, and other small invertebrates.

Male coloration includes a dusky back with white spots, bluish sides with bright yellow stripes and spots. In contrast, females and young individuals are dark brown or dusky with white spots.

Boxfish are closely related to pufferfish, with whom they maintain symbiotic relationships with toxic bacteria. Unlike pufferfish, boxfish use a toxic mucus secreted from specialized cells for defense. Their bright coloration serves as a warning of danger, a phenomenon known as aposematism.

The scales of boxfish fuse into a solid, box-like carapace, leaving only fins, tail, eyes, and mouth exposed. This provides them with additional protection. Boxfish move slowly, relying on their pectoral fins. Like other boxfish, they quickly retreat to shelter in danger and often remain stationary, observing their surroundings.

They live in small harems, where one male courts several females. Males are territorial and defend their territory from competitors. Mating occurs high above the reef, where the male approaches the female and initiates the process.

During mating, the male or female, sometimes both, emit a low-frequency hum lasting about 6 seconds. Another example - after the mating process, when another male comes to "deposit" or interrupt the mating process, the two males fight each other, sometimes creating an audible thud and even emit a short buzzing sound.
