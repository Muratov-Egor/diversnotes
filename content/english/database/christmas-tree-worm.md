"Christmas tree" (Spirobranchus giganteus) or Christmas tree worm is a species of polychaete worms from the family Serpulidae. Widely distributed in the tropical seas of the World Ocean. Lead a sessile lifestyle in close association with madrepore corals, building in depressions on the surface of their colonies of calcareous tubes.

Branches "herringbone" in the marine worm - are respiratory and digestive organs. With their help, he filters water, receives nutrients and oxygen. Its pinnate tentacles help it move through the water. Tubular polychaetes are almost unable to swim and lead a sedentary life.


The polychaete worm lives in a calcareous tube, which it builds by itself, extracting calcium ions from water and binding them with saliva. Each time this tube is replenished with new rings and increases in size.

Most often, Christmas tree worms inhabit large coral species, such as stony corals like Porites, and brain corals. When a Christmas tree worm goes into a tube, it can seal it off by closing with a hatch-like lid called an operculum, which is further protected by sharp spines. Very sensitive to danger, at the slightest touch or even a fall the shadows quickly retreat to their burrows.

Just like a Christmas tree, sea worms are painted in rich colors, their shades can be completely different colors: yellow, red, blue, black, pink, white, etc. Find a sea worm can be found at shallow depths among corals.

Spirobranchus giganteus lives differently, it all depends on the species: smaller worms - a few months, and larger species - up to 4-8 years.
