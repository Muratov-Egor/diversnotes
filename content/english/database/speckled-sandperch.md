The speckled sandperch (Parapercis hexophtalma), also known as the white-spotted sandperch, is a member of the Parapercis genus. There are distinct differences in appearance between males and females.

The speckled sandperch is found in the Indo-West Pacific region. They typically inhabit sandy and gravelly areas between reefs and can be found at depths of up to 18 meters.

Speckled sandperches feed on zooplankton, small crustaceans, and fish.

They are often seen in sandy areas and among rubble between reefs. They rest on the bottom, propping themselves up with their pectoral fins, and make quick dashes upwards. They appear to have exceptionally good eyesight. When approached by a diver, they usually stay on the bottom, but if one gets too close, they dart away quickly. They are often observed in pairs.

The speckled sandperch has a slightly compressed cylindrical body that tapers towards the rear. The eyes are set high on the head, close to each other. The fish has rather fleshy lips. The dorsal fin extends along the body, while the anal fin, which starts in the middle of the body, is also proportionately long. The pelvic fins are also long.

Females have a series of spots along the upper part of the body and 7-8 vertical bars on the belly. Some of these bars may have yellow spots ringed with black. The face is lightly speckled with small spots. The tail has a noticeable black mark.

Males are larger than females and have a series of spots along the back. The bars on the belly are lighter, and there are usually three yellow spots ringed with black low on the mid-belly. The face has yellow and black lines. They can grow up to a maximum length of 17 cm.

Little is known about the mating habits of this species. Like most sandperches, they are sequential hermaphrodites, starting their adult life as females and later becoming males, likely triggered by social cues. There are significantly more females than males, and each male guards a harem of two to three females. Spawning occurs at dusk when the male and female swim off the bottom and release eggs and sperm into the water.
