The bigeye snapper (Lutjanus lutjanus) is a medium-sized fish, typically reaching a length of up to 35 cm, though it can grow up to 60 cm. It has a robust, elongated body with a slightly compressed shape. The fish is distinguished by its large eyes, which are adapted for seeing in low-light conditions. Its coloration is usually silver or pale yellow, with a noticeable dark spot at the base of the pectoral fin. The fins are yellowish, and the dorsal fin has a slightly dark edge.

It inhabits the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa to the central part of the Pacific Ocean. It dwells in coral reefs, lagoons, and outer reef slopes, typically at depths ranging from 10 to 100 meters. These fish often form large schools.

The bigeye snapper reproduces through external fertilization. During the spawning period, which often occurs in large aggregations, females release eggs into the water column, and males simultaneously release sperm to fertilize them. The eggs are pelagic, floating in the open water until they hatch. The larvae then drift with the plankton before settling and developing into juvenile fish.

It primarily feeds on small fish and crustaceans. They often hunt in groups, using their large eyes to spot prey in low-light conditions. They also consume various invertebrates.
