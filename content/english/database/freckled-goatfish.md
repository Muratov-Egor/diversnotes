The Freckled Goatfish (Upeneus tragula) is a small to medium-sized fish, typically ranging from 15 to 20 cm in length. It has a distinctive elongated body with a slightly compressed shape. The coloration of the fish is generally pale pink to reddish with a series of dark brown or black spots scattered along its sides. These spots give it a freckled appearance, which is a key identifying feature. The fish also has two long barbels (whisker-like appendages) on its chin, which it uses to detect food on the ocean floor.

Freckled Goatfish are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. They inhabit sandy and muddy bottoms, often near coral reefs or seagrass beds. These fish are typically seen at depths ranging from 1 to 50 meters, where they can easily forage for food.

Upeneus tragula reproduces by spawning, where females release eggs into the water column and males fertilize them externally. The eggs are pelagic, meaning they float in the open water until they hatch. The larvae then develop and settle on the bottom as they mature.

Freckled Goatfish primarily feed on small invertebrates, such as crustaceans, worms, and mollusks. They use their sensitive barbels to detect prey hidden in the sand or mud.

Freckled Goatfish are not dangerous to divers. They are generally shy and will swim away when approached.
