The yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrina), also known as the banded sea krait or the yellow-lipped sea krait, is a species of venomous sea snake found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. The snake has distinctive black bands and a yellow snout, along with a paddle-shaped tail adapted for swimming.

It spends most of its time underwater hunting but returns to land to digest food, rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom, which it uses to hunt eels and small fish. Due to its tendency to come ashore, the yellow-lipped sea krait often encounters humans, but it is not aggressive and will only attack if it feels threatened.

The head of the yellow-lipped sea krait is black, with lateral nostrils and an undivided rostral scale. The upper lip and snout are characteristically yellow, extending back from each side of the head above the eye to the temporal scales.

The snake's body is taller than it is wide. The upper surface is usually bluish-grey, while the belly is yellowish, with broad ventral scales that take up a third to more than half the width of the body. The snake's tail is paddle-shaped and adapted for swimming.

On average, the total length of a male is 9 cm, with a tail length of 13 cm. Females are significantly larger, reaching up to 1.4 meters in length.

The yellow-lipped sea krait is widely distributed across the eastern Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the eastern coast of India along the coast of the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and other parts of Southeast Asia, to the Malay Archipelago and parts of southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands in Japan. The species is also found near Fiji and other Pacific islands within its range. Wandering individuals have been recorded in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. It is the most common sea krait found in New Zealand and the second most common sea snake after the yellow-bellied sea snake, frequently encountered enough to be considered a native species protected under the Wildlife Act of 1953.

Yellow-lipped sea kraits are semi-aquatic. Juveniles remain in the water and on adjacent shorelines, but adults can move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more active on land during mating and hunt in shallow waters. Adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper waters. Since males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.

Body adaptations, especially the paddle-shaped tail, help yellow-lipped sea kraits swim. These adaptations are also found in more distant relatives of sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) due to convergent evolution, but due to differences in movement between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations make land movement difficult for the snake. On land, the yellow-lipped sea krait can move, but usually at a speed of just over one-fifth of its swimming speed. Unlike most sea snakes, apart from species in Laticauda, other sea snakes are practically stranded on land.

While hunting, yellow-lipped sea kraits often venture into deep waters far from shore but return to land to digest food, shed skin, and reproduce.
