The snowflake moray, also known as the clouded moray or Echidna nebulosa, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Muraenidae.

Its Hawaiian name "puhi-kapa" originates from a nickname given by King Kamehameha I. The genus name comes from the Greek word "echidna," which translates to "viper," and the species name "nebulosa" derives from the Latin "nebulosus," meaning "cloudy" or "misty."

Snowflake morays can reach sizes of up to 100 cm, but they are typically around 50 cm in length. These fish inhabit depths ranging from 1 to 48 meters.

Snowflake morays populate caves and crevices in the coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, from the Hawaiian Islands to Australia, extending westward across the islands of the Indo-Pacific, to the Eastern Indian Ocean islands, and across the Indian Ocean to the coast of Africa.

Their bodies are colored in white or cream with black dendritic or jagged spots, sometimes with yellow dots. Their eyes are yellow, and their heads display yellow markings. Two yellow tubular nostrils protrude from their nostrils, pointing downward, with another pair closer to the eyes. Their vision is weak, but they compensate with a well-developed sense of smell. The teeth of the snowflake moray are adapted for feeding on crustaceans, and their conical shape helps crush the exoskeletons of invertebrates. In the wild, these morays primarily feed on fish.

Sexual differences in morays are not pronounced. They are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning the more dominant individual can change from female to male. This can pose challenges, as morays are typically peaceful. The sex change process can take several months to a year.

Snowflake morays play a crucial role in dispersing their eggs, which they release into the water during spawning. Their eggs and larvae drift with plankton until settling on a reef, where they hatch.
