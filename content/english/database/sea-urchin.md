Diadema antillarum, or the long-spined sea urchin, also known as the black sea urchin, is a member of the family Diadematidae.

While the long-spined sea urchin  may appear intimidating due to its long spines, it plays a crucial role in maintaining coral reef ecosystems. These sea urchins prefer warm shallow areas, typically at depths of 3 to 10 meters. They hide in crevices, exposing only their spines, though they can sometimes be found in more open areas. At night, they move about a meter from their shelters in search of food. They are highly sensitive to light and therefore choose shaded spots.

The main feature of Diadema antillarum is its spines, which are usually 10-12 cm long, and in larger specimens can reach up to 30 cm, whereas most sea urchins have spines that are 1-3 cm long.

These spines are very brittle and can break off, embedding in predators that attempt to attack them. They are also coated with a toxic substance that deters small predators.

Sea urchins are some of the oldest creatures in the ocean, having existed for over 450 million years, which is 200 million years before the dinosaurs appeared. They belong to the echinoderms, which means "spiny skin" and includes starfish, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers. Almost all echinoderms have five identical body parts, and the long-spined sea urchin is no exception. Underneath its spines, you can see five calcium carbonate plates supporting the urchin's body.

The name long-spined sea urchin comes from its long black and white spines. It moves across the reef using tube feet that work hydraulically. By taking in water through its respiratory system, the urchin inflates and straightens its feet, allowing it to move and gather food.

Long-spined sea urchins reproduce through broadcast spawning from July to September, releasing their eggs into the water. The larvae, called echinoplutei, swim freely and can travel long distances on ocean currents before settling on new reefs. After 4-6 weeks, the larvae mature, losing their swimming structures and developing long spines, enabling the urchins to spread over vast distances.

These sea urchins are voracious algae eaters, earning them the nickname "ocean lawnmowers." They daily clean the reefs of algae, creating conditions for coral growth and supporting the reef ecosystem.

Diadema antillarum remains one of the most numerous and ecologically significant sea urchin species in shallow waters in tropical regions. They can be found in the tropical waters of the Western Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coast of South America down to Brazil, as well as in the Eastern Atlantic around the Canary Islands and in the Indian Ocean. These urchins help control algae growth, which can overwhelm coral reefs.

The population of long-spined sea urchins in the Caribbean significantly declined in 1983, leading to devastating consequences for the reefs. The reasons for this die-off are still debated, but possible factors include climate change, water quality issues, and diseases caused by untreated sewage discharge.

The mass mortality of urchins led to an overgrowth of algae that choked the corals and hindered the settlement of new coral larvae. This caused a "phase shift," where the coral reefs became overrun with algae. Without sea urchins, this situation could become irreversible.

Despite these challenges, there is reason for optimism. Scientists are actively working on restoring the population of long-spined sea urchins, and by supporting reef protection, we can help them recover.
