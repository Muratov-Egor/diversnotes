The Blue Ring Angelfish, also known as the Annularis Angelfish and the Blue King Angelfish, derives its name from the distinctive blue ring near its head. The scientific name Pomacanthus annularis also contributes to its designation as the Annularis Angelfish.

Juvenile Blue Ring Angelfish exhibit a strikingly different appearance compared to adults. While juveniles display black bodies with blue and white vertical stripes, adults feature an orange-yellow body adorned with horizontal blue stripes, a yellow tail, and the characteristic blue ring near the head.

Found in the Indo-West Pacific oceans, their habitat spans from East Africa, throughout Indonesia and New Guinea to New Caledonia, and north to southern Japan. Bluering Angelfish prefer coastal rocky coral reefs, occasionally venturing into caves or exploring wrecks, typically at depths of 3–30 meters.

Often encountered in pairs, Bluering Angelfish, like other Pomacanthus species, form harems where males defend territories and oversee a few females. During courtship, males and females release eggs and sperm. Juveniles start life as females (protogynous hermaphrodites), transitioning into males as they mature, accompanied by a complete transformation in coloration from juvenile to adult stage. Juveniles tend to inhabit very shallow waters with rock or dead coral substrates and short filamentous algae, while adults primarily feed on zooplankton, sponges, filamentous algae, and tunicates.
