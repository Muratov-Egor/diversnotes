These small groupers are sometimes yellow-red or brick-colored without vertical stripes, but more often they have five broad dark vertical stripes on their body, which are most visible at the base of the dorsal fin.

A distinctive feature of these groupers is the noticeable black triangular spots above the tip of each dorsal fin spine. The eyes have a narrow black ring.

The blacktip grouper has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. Its range extends from the Red Sea to the Eastern Cape in South Africa, east to the Pitcairn Islands, north to southern Japan and Korea, and south to New Caledonia and Australia. It is found in Madagascar, the Mascarene Islands, the Comoros, and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. In Australia, it occurs from Outman Abrolhos in Western Australia north to the tropical coast and south to Port Hacking in New South Wales. It can also be found on reefs in the Coral Sea, on Elizabeth Reef, around Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, and on Christmas Island. A record was reported in 2012 from the eastern Mediterranean, off Lebanon.

The blacktip grouper feeds on crustaceans and small fish, ambushing them. It inhabits coral reefs from a depth of 4 meters (usually from 15 meters) to 160 meters, in both marine and brackish water, sometimes in groups of 10-15 individuals. Young individuals may seek shelter in mangrove swamps.

This species can exhibit simultaneous hermaphroditism in smaller individuals, while larger individuals usually lose their female function.
