Dischistodus perspicillatus, also known as the striped-eye damsel or white damsel, is notable for the distinct stripes on its head and eyes. Adults have a light-colored body with dark vertical stripes running from the eyes to the gills. These fish possess an oval, slightly compressed body typical of the Pomacentridae family. They grow to about 14-16 cm in length. Adults can also display bright colors, including shades of yellow and blue.

White damsel is found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, especially around the Great Barrier Reef, Indonesia, and the Philippines. These fish prefer to live among coral reefs at depths of 1 to 15 meters, often in protected areas such as lagoons and inner reefs.

Dischistodus perspicillatus is an omnivorous fish. Their diet includes algae, plankton, small crustaceans, and other invertebrates. These fish often graze on the reefs, nibbling algae off the surfaces of corals and feeding on small organisms they find within the coral structures.

Reproduction in White damsel occurs through spawning. Males build nests from algae and other materials on the seabed, where females lay their eggs. Males actively guard the clutch until the fry hatch, fending off potential predators. The larvae float in the plankton until they reach a stage where they can settle on the bottom and begin living among the corals.

White damsel poses no threat to divers. These fish are non-aggressive and non-toxic. During the breeding season, males may exhibit territorial behavior to protect their nests, but overall they are harmless to humans. Divers are advised to avoid touching corals and fish to prevent harm to the environment and stress to marine life.
