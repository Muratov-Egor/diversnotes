The Melon Butterflyfish (Chaetodon trifasciatus) is a vibrant and colorful fish, typically growing up to 15 cm in length. It has a laterally compressed body, which is characteristic of butterflyfish. The body is primarily yellow with a series of vertical blue lines. It features three distinct black bands: one running through the eye, another just behind the head, and the third one at the base of the tail. The dorsal fin is continuous and features the same coloration pattern. Its striking appearance makes it easily identifiable among reef fish.

Chaetodon trifasciatus is found in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, from the eastern coast of Africa to the islands of the central Indian Ocean. It primarily inhabits coral reefs, often seen at depths ranging from 1 to 20 meters. These fish prefer areas with abundant coral growth, which provide both food and shelter.

Melon Butterflyfish reproduce through external fertilization. During the breeding season, males and females engage in courtship displays. The female releases eggs into the water column, which are then fertilized by the male. The eggs are pelagic, floating in the open water until they hatch. The larvae go through a planktonic stage before settling onto the reef and developing into juvenile fish.

The diet of Chaetodon trifasciatus mainly consists of coral polyps, making them obligate corallivores. They feed on the soft tissues of corals, particularly favoring Acropora and Pocillopora species. They also consume small invertebrates and algae to supplement their diet.

Melon Butterflyfish are not dangerous to divers. They are known for their shy and peaceful nature. While they may approach divers out of curiosity, they pose no threat. Their behavior and diet make them harmless to humans.
