The sunken ferry King Cruiser is located in the open sea about 30 km east of Phuket Island.

The ferry was built in Japan in 1969 and was originally named Rokko Maru. In 1990, it was sold to Songserm Travel Center and renamed King Cruiser, after which it began operating between Phuket and the Phi Phi Islands in Thailand. The ferry was designed to carry 600 passengers and had three decks. The vessel measured 85 meters in length and 25 meters in width.

On May 4, 1997, it was a clear, sunny day with no wind or waves. The King Cruiser was on its regular route to the Phi Phi Islands.

According to one version of events, the captain decided to deviate from the usual course, and the ferry struck Anemone Reef, which is barely visible underwater. There are rumors that another person might have been at the helm, but this has not been confirmed. Another theory suggests that the captain tried to take a shortcut and changed the usual course, although this is unlikely as the captain was well aware of the dangerous reef in the area.

There is also a theory that the ship might have been deliberately steered onto the reef for insurance fraud, as there were no cars on the ferry that day.

As a result of the collision, the vessel sustained a breach and began to sink, descending to the sandy seabed at a depth of about 33 meters over the course of 2.5 hours. No one was injured in the incident, but the true motive behind that day's events remains a mystery.

Over time, the King Cruiser has become one of the most popular dive sites around Phuket and Phi Phi. The highest point of the sunken ship is at a depth of 16 meters, while the lowest part lies on the sandy bottom at 30-33 meters.

Unfortunately, the light structure of the car ferry, with its large areas not supported by sturdy beams, led to the vessel's rapid disintegration. Strong currents combined with warm water accelerated this process. Currently, there are no noticeable penetration points left, as all three decks have collapsed onto the main platform between the two hulls of the catamaran.

The King Cruiser dive site is suitable for divers with an Advanced Open Water Diver certification and for specialized courses such as Wreck Diver and Nitrox Diver. A descent line is anchored at the stern of the ferry, which is particularly useful in strong currents. Due to everyone starting and ending the dive at the same spot and around the same time, there can be a bit of a crowd during the safety stop. However, every time I've dived there, it has been friendly, and everyone tries to help each other out.

The sunken ferry is covered in soft and hard corals, attracting various species of fish. Around the ship, you can see large schools of small fish, tuna, barracudas, and leopard sharks. Inside, there are large groupers, snappers, and giant barracudas. The site is also rich in lionfish, scorpionfish, and stonefish.

The King Cruiser dive site offers exciting opportunities for both experienced and novice divers. Various parts of the ship are accessible for exploration, including the engine room with its narrow passages, ideal for sidemount divers. Safe dive routes are available for beginners.

The water temperature at the dive site is consistently 28-30 degrees Celsius year-round. Depending on the weather conditions, water visibility ranges from 5 to 15 meters. Since the ferry is located in open water, strong currents are quite common here.
