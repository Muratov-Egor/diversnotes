Shark Point, also known as Hin Musang ("wild cat rock" in Thai), is located in open sea between Phuket and Phi Phi Islands. The dive site is renowned for its pink-purple coral gardens and zebra sharks. Shark Point has been part of a marine sanctuary since 1992, where fishing is prohibited, making it an excellent place for exploring the underwater world of the Andaman Sea.

Shark Point got its name due to frequent encounters with zebra sharks peacefully resting on the sandy bottom. Although the number of sharks has decreased due to the increasing number of boats coming here, the site remains one of the most beautiful for diving, thanks to its healthy coral reef and diversity of marine life.

The dive site consists of a group of underwater pinnacles, spaced apart, running from north to south at depths ranging from 5 meters to over 25 meters. Each subsequent pinnacle is slightly lower and deeper than the previous one.

Diving is accessible to divers of all certification levels, although strong currents and variable visibility can make it challenging for less experienced divers.

Diving at Shark Point is done only on the first three pinnacles — two of which do not reach the surface, and the third, the northernmost one with a small beacon, protrudes only a few meters above the water. The beacon serves as an important navigational aid, guiding boats safely around the diving area and helping divers find key points of interest. Divers typically enter the water at this northernmost pinnacle. Depending on the direction and intensity of the current, divers move along the eastern or western side of the pinnacle. If the current is not strong, it is possible to circumnavigate the first pinnacle and then head south to the second pinnacle.

The second pinnacle has a gentle slope to the north and ends with a vertical wall to the south. The top of this wall is at a depth of 5-6 meters, allowing for a comfortable safety stop even in very strong currents — just hide behind the rock and enjoy the beautiful soft corals covering the top of the pinnacle.

At the second pinnacle, you can encounter the largest gorgonian sea fans and barrel sponges among all dive sites in Phuket and Phi Phi. Since this reef is located fairly remotely, it attracts a huge variety of schooling fish such as barracudas, batfish, giant trevallies, yellow snappers, tunas, and groupers, as well as numerous macro critters including seahorses and ghost fish.

Additionally, Shark Point is home to cuttlefish and squid, which often hide in various shelters. The site is also famous for its diverse soft corals and anemones that inhabit the underwater rocks. Among the colorful coral diversity, various species of moray eels live, from small fimbriated morays to giant and zebra morays. Red lionfish, octopuses, cute little Nemo fish, parrotfish, giant mollusks, frogfish, and seahorses are also part of the incomplete list of what divers can see when diving at this wonderful reef. The presence of currents and a large amount of plankton attracts large marine animals such as manta rays and whale sharks.
